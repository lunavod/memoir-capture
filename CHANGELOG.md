# Changelog

## 0.1.4

### Fixed
- Detect window closure via `IsWindow()` check in `GetNextFrame()` when the
  WGC `Closed` event does not fire. The engine now reliably transitions to
  `Faulted` with error `"Capture target closed"` when the captured window
  is destroyed.

### Added
- Test for window-close detection (`test_window_close.py`).

## 0.1.3

### Added
- `start_recording(path=, video_name=, meta_name=)` overload for placing
  video and metadata files under a directory with separate names.
  Redundant `.mp4`/`.meta` extensions are stripped automatically.
- Syntax sugar for `MetaFile`, `FramePacket`, and engine (sequence protocol,
  key lookup helpers, `save_png`, `on_frame` callback, `grab()` convenience).

## 0.1.2

### Added
- Custom `key_map` parameter for `CaptureEngine` to select which keys are
  tracked in the keyboard bitmask.
- Engine and metadata documentation (`docs/engine.md`).

### Fixed
- Support `(?i)` case-insensitive flag in window regex patterns.

## 0.1.1

### Fixed
- Finalize recording on destructor when engine is faulted.
- CI: skip `cv2` import on headless runners, cache vcpkg on failure.
- CI: fix cache key and `save-always` deprecation issues.

### Changed
- Renamed Python import from `memoir` to `memoir_capture`.
- Renamed PyPI package to `memoir-capture`.

## 0.1.0

### Added
- Initial implementation of Memoir capture/replay module.
- Windows Graphics Capture (WGC) backend with monitor index, window title
  regex, and window exe regex targets.
- Hardware-accelerated HEVC recording via NVENC with `.mp4` + `.meta` output.
- Python bindings via pybind11 with `CaptureEngine`, `FramePacket`, and
  `RecordingInfo` types.
- Typed Python wrapper package with dataclasses for all return values.
- `.meta` binary format with per-frame keyboard bitmask, QPC timestamps,
  and resolution info.
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions, PyPI trusted publishing, and GitHub Releases.
- pytest test suite with `--headless` marker for CI runners.
